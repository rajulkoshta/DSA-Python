#  Today is the most important day in DSA course. We will start Linked List. All topics here on out will be based on concepts of linked lists. Must-Attend if you can.

# Day14:
#     association of data
#     class
#     pass
#     objects
#     _init_
#     self
#     functions
#     dunder methods : _add_ , _len_ , _repr_

#     linked lists:
#         reason
#         base idea
#         implementation
#         vs array

#     example:
#         creation
#         print LL // counting (iterative / recursive)
#         insert at Last
#         insert at front
#         delete element at kth position

#     types: singly doubly circular
